# ng-book 2: The Complete Guide to Angular 4 Sample Code

## Organization

Hi! Here's the sample code for the book.

It's organized by `chapter/topic`. Generally, in the book we call out where you can find each code example. 

## Running the code

Check the `README` in each project's directory to learn how to run the code. Generally every project is built on [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), which means they have a consistent toolchain for building and running. To run these projects do the following:

```bash
cd path/to/project
npm install 
npm start 
```

Then open the project in your browser. Generally at the URL http://localhost:4200

## Feedback & Bug Reports

We're still writing updates the book and this code. If you have any feedback on things that aren't clear, or find any bugs just email us at: us@fullstack.io

Cheers!

Nate, Ari, and the ng-book 2 team
